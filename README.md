## BIO

Hello! I am Leslie Li, an undergraduate at the University of Rochester. I am a Brain & Cognitive Sciences major, as well as a music major. There is also a Latin minor that must be done. You can find me in the HLP lab, library or practice room. If I'm not at any of those places, I must be at a concert. Or on the way to a concert. 

When I feel like it, I tend to stay in the practice room for hours; when it pleases me, I tend to code (no, debug) or solve math problems until 4am. When I am relatively normal, I am a morning person.
