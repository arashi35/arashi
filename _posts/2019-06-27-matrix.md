## Vectors

By default, the column vectors are used for this discussion.

### Dot product

The analogy of the dot product is a  

### Cross product

## Matrix Multiplication

> **AB** = **C**

 For two matrices, **A** and **B**, if A is of size *n* × *m* and B is of size
 *m* × *p*, then **A** × **B** is valid and will yield a new matrix of size *n* × *p*.

### Relation to dot product

For two column vectors, the dot product of these vectors is the matrix product
