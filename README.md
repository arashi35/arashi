## BIO

Hello! I am Leslie Li, an undergraduate at the University of Rochester. I am a Brain & Cognitive Sciences major, as well as a Music major. There is also a Latin minor that must be done. You can find me in the HLP lab, library or practice room. If I'm not at any of those places, I must be at a concert. Or on the way to a concert. 

When I don't feel like anything else, I tend to stay in the practice room for hours; when it pleases me, I tend to code (no, debug) or solve math problems until 4am. When I am relatively normal, I am a morning person.

## Some Resources
*(note: these things will stay here until I find a way to create subpages)*
### Ways to learn a thing (online courses, videos or books)
Machine learning: coursera online course by Andrew Ng
https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
- not much math background required
- as an online course, easy to understand and homeworks are useful
- also how I got started with Matlab
- quite a nice summer of debugging memories

R language and RStudio: online book by Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham (physical copy available on Amazon)
http://r4ds.had.co.nz/
- instructions are quite clear
- advantage of an online book: can directly copy & paste codes to RStudio
- suggestion: get some data of your own, and have fun with it!
