## Vectors

By default, column vectors are used for this discussion.

### Dot product

The analogy of the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) is one vector's 
projection times the other vector:

$$\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = \left \| \vec{a} \right \|\left \| \vec{b} \right \| \cos{\theta }$$

### Cross product

## Matrix Multiplication

$$AB = C$$

 For two matrices, **A** and **B**, if A is of size *n* × *m* and B is of size
 *m* × *p*, then **A** × **B** is valid and will yield a new matrix of size *n* × *p*.

### Relation to dot product

For two column vectors, the dot product of these vectors is the matrix product

<mid> x<sup>T</sup>y </mid>

### Dot product and 

## Determinant

Think of the determinant as the area of a 2D matrix, or the volume of a 3D matrix, etc. The area of anything in the 
2D/3D sapce after the transformation
